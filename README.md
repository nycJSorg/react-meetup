# ReactNYC

[ReactNYC](http://meetup.com/ReactNYC/) is a bi-weekly meetup for React and React Native developers.

The goal of this project is to open source the meetup, allowing everybody interested in giving back to the community to parciticpate in organizing ReactNYC events.

This is a new and highly experimental project. Every task is represented as a github issue, feel free to use the comments for any questions.
